1) DOCUMENT YOUR DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR HUMANS

Our humans are passionately living and exploring peer to peer lifestyles. We have diverse skills and backgrounds but all are committed to the same goal of personal control of information. As users and developers of our own tools, we hope all users feel the same empowerment over their information.

2) WHAT’S YOUR PURPOSE AND PASSIONS

We are passionate about individual empowerment for the information age. We believe all information should be recorded and owned by it's creator. Cryptography and modern collaborative data structures called distributed hash trees allow this for the first time ever. Guld exists to research and develop the potential of this technology.

3) STATE YOUR VALUES

Our values are individual empowerment, specifically over data. Each individual should own and control their own data of all sorts, including but not limited to financial, medical, and personal records.

4) WHAT’S GULD’S STORY

Guld was born out of a collaborative R&D team researching ways to govern their projects. Originally named `gitguild`, the concept was to modernize the professional organization model pioneered by midieval guilds. The modern guild would use file version tracking system `git` to manage it's membership, records, and events. After building a few prototypes, it became clear that this governance and file tracking technology had much broader applications. At the same time, we decided to rebrand to a simpler, less legally restricted name: `guld`.

5) WHAT’S THE GULD EXPERIENCE

The experience we're trying to provide is as close to a normal internet experience as we can get. For instance, the most basic way to use guld is by installing a plugin for your email client and sending mail like normal. We're developing a chat app that will not be so different from telegram, or whatsapp, but will have integrated encryption, signing, and transactions. We're also creating an operating system that integrates the key management, signing, and distributed storage aspects behind the scenes. Users will simply interact with files and applications like normal.

6) DEFINE YOUR STANDARD OF QUALITY

Our standards are as high as can be mathematically defined. Our goal is to produce "formally verified" systems, which is to say, software and hardware which have had their functions and implementation audited with mathematical exactness. While this is an extremely high goal, which we do not expect to achieve within 5 years, it is the long term expectation.

7) DOCUMENT YOUR STRENGTHS

Our strengths are in technology and stability. We are on the bleeding edge of the distributed hash tree sector, among a few of the "next generation" blockchains known as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We stand out in our class by using stable, audited components with their own ecosystems, specifically git and PGP.

8) DEFINE YOUR INDUSTRY RULES

Our industry is very strict about decentralization, peer to peer relationships, open source IP, and accountability. The sector is the leading edge of both peer to peer networking and transparent functionality, and we're on the edge of that. The most important thing is to engage people directly, or better yet, empower them to engage each other.
