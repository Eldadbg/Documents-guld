New Computers For The Decentralized Internet
============
__[TigoCTM](https://tigoctm.com/) Announces ICO to Manufacture Computers For The Decentralized Internet__

**Panama City, Panama:** Blockchain powered ATM operator TigoCTM is announcing a new line of products focused on trustless computing. Each machine will be custom built with user rights and privacy at the forefront, featuring Bitcoin, Dash, and Ethereum pre-installed, as well as encrypted folders and file sharing using the guld decentralized file system. To fund the first generation of hardware manufacturing, TigoCTM is offering Ethereum gift certificate tokens (XCM) at up to 50% discount.

With the blockchain sector topping $200 billion and still growing exponentially, Internet infrastructure is still stuck in 1990. Centralized companies keep user data and money unencrypted, on servers that are rarely up to date with security patches and standards. Everyone from national governments and businesses down to individuals are concerned about the security and privacy of their data.

__[TigoCTM](https://tigoctm.com/)__ devices will address these concerns with custom hardware for every layer of the network stack. Depending on how much the ICO raises, TigoCTM will manufacture the following:
  
  * Desktop
  * Server
  * Laptop
  * Tablet
  * Teller Machine
  * Smart Phone
  
Each of these devices will include a hardware security module for managing file encryption and wallet keys. Devices will synchronize with each other, creating a private cloud for each user to back up and manage their own data, as well as a larger decentralized network for interacting with other users.

Whether you are a blockchain business, investor, or are simply concerned about privacy, TigoCTM will help you modernize and take control of your information.
