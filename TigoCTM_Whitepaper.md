## Overview
TigoCTM will manufacture computing devices with built in openPGP hardware security modules, and guldOS pre-installed. This enhances the Single Password Environment that guldOS creates with dedicated signing hardware and professionally chosen compiler flags.

## Ecosystem

TigoCTM hopes to create a completely new ecosystem from the server infrastructure to your smart phone. Each of these devices will synchronize with each over the P2P guldFS network.

Depending on the use case, the device could have an openPGP hardware module inserted and then begin signing and acting on behalf of an identity, or it could have an embedded hardware module, with a single, resident identity.

## Blockchains

TigoCTM devices will all be able to interact with the Bitcoin, Dash, and Ethereum blockchains. The method of interaction, however, will be determined by the capacity of the host device.
